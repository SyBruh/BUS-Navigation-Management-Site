# BUS-Navigation-Management-Site
Today, many public transportation systems around the world use a prepaid system. Singapore uses the Ezlink card for public transportation. 
However, businesses that use cards and prepayments are not yet used on Burma's public transport. 
To solve this problem, I am going to create a benevolence system using prepaid system payments via mobile applications inside public transportation. 
This system will be implemented on the phone through the application. This pre-system is expected to provide a better and more convenient payment system. 
With the construction of this system, it is hoped that it can alleviate the problems that currently occur in the cash payment system. 
Under the cash payment system, some people board the bus without paying. 
For those who are not used to taking buses, getting on the wrong bus can be annoying. 
This advanced system can eliminate the above problems with the aim of making bus travel more comfortable for the people. 
The system also allows passengers to search for bus schedules and routes, so that they know the bus routes and times. 
This system was first used with a virtual server of the Bank and is expected to be used practically in the future.  
Since the system is through the mobile application, the environment is set up by creating a virtual server for the Yangon bus system and another server for the bank with payments
